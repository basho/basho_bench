   Basho Bench is a benchmarking tool created to conduct accurate and
   repeatable performance tests and stress tests, and produce
   performance graphs.

   Originally developed to benchmark Riak, it exposes a pluggable
   driver interface and has been extended to serve as a benchmarking
   tool across a variety of projects.

   Basho Bench focuses on two metrics of performance:

   - Throughput: number of operations performed in a timeframe,
     captured in aggregate across all operation types
   - Latency: time to complete single operations, captured in
     quantiles per-operation

** Quick Start

   You must have [[http://erlang.org/download.html][Erlang/OTP R16]] or later to build and run Basho
   Bench, and [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] to generate graphs of your benchmarks.  A sane
   GNU-style build system is also required if you want to use =make=
   to build the project.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git://github.com/basho/basho_bench.git
cd basho_bench
make all
#+END_SRC
   
   This will build an executable script, =basho_bench=, which you can
   use to run one of the existing benchmark configurations from the
   =examples/= directory. You will likely have to make some minor directory
   changes to the configs in order to get the examples running (see, e.g., the 
   source of the bitcask and innostore benchmark config files for direction).

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./basho_bench examples/riakc_pb.config
INFO: Est. data size: 95.37 MB
INFO: Using target ip {127,0,0,1} for worker 1
INFO: Starting max worker: <0.55.0>
#+END_SRC

   At the end of the benchmark, results will be available in CSV
   format in the =tests/current/= directory. Now you can generate a
   graph:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make results
priv/summary.r -i tests/current
Loading required package: proto
Loading required package: reshape
Loading required package: plyr
Loading required package: digest
null device 
          1 
$ open tests/current/summary.png
#+END_SRC

** Running as an Application

   You can also run basho_bench as an included app rather than an escript. In order to compile and run basho_bench as an included app, you can use =make run=. You can also include basho_bench as a dependency in another app. basho_bench can be started with =basho_bench:start()= or from the command-line with =erl -s basho_bench=. Once you have a shell with basho_bench running, you can run benchmarks with the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
basho_bench:setup_benchmark([]).
basho_bench:run_benchmark(["/path/to/config"]).
#+END_SRC

=basho_bench:setup_benchmark/1= accepts a proplist of configuration options. These options are the same as the options which are passed to basho_bench via the command line when compiled as an escript.

** Troubleshooting Graph Generation

   If make results fails with the error =/usr/bin/env: Rscript --vanilla: No such file or directory=
   please edit priv/summary.r and replace the first line with the full path to the Rscript binary on your system

   If you receive the error message =Warning: unable to access index for repository http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/src/contrib= 
   it means the default R repo for installing additional packages is broken, you can change it as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ R
> chooseCRANmirror()
Selection: 69
quit()
make results
#+END_SRC

** Customizing your Benchmark
   Basho Bench has many drivers, each with its own configuration, and
   a number of key and value generators that you can use to customize
   your benchmark. It is also straightforward -- with less than 200
   lines of Erlang code -- to create custom drivers that can exercise
   other systems or perform custom operations. These are covered more
   in detail in the [[http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/benchmarking/][documentation]].

*** Duration vs Op-Count termination
   Benchmarks by default are time-duration limited, meaning you specify
   a number of minutes for the benchmark to run using the `duration`
   configuration parameter.
   Additionally you may specify the `op_counter` configuration parameter,
   which is set up as an iteration-limited Key Generator, such as the
   `partitioned_sequential_int`. Once this op_counter has been exhausted
   for a particular worker, that worker will quit, waiting for other workers
   to complete before shutting down basho_bench.

   Example Configuration:
   ```
   {op_counter, {int_to_str, {partitioned_sequential_int, 100}}}.
   ```

** Benchmarking with riak-java-client
   The [[https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client][riak-java-client]] can be used to benchmark a Riak cluster. There
   is an example configuration in =examples/riakc_java.config=. You
   will need the [[https://github.com/basho/bench_shim][bench_shim]] project. You will also need to uncomment
   and edit the following line in basho_bench's =rebar.config=, adding
   your own erlang cookie value:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
%% {escript_emu_args, "%%! -name bb@127.0.0.1 -setcookie YOUR_ERLANG_COOKIE\n"}.
#+END_SRC

** Alternative Graph Generation by gnuplot
   You can generate graphs using gnuplot.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./priv/gp_throughput.sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./priv/gp_latencies.sh
#+END_SRC

   By passing =-h= option to each script, help messages are shown.

   Some of options for these scripts are:

   - =-d TEST_DIR= : comma separated list of directories which include
         test result CSV files
   - =-t TERMINAL_TYPE= : gnuplot terminal type
   - =-P= : just print gnuplot script without drawing graph

   For example, you can draw graphs with ASCII characters
   by the option =-t dumb=, which is useful in non-graphical
   environment or quick sharing of result in chat.

   Also, you can plot multiple test runs on a single plot by using "-d" switch.

** Benchmarking Erlang cluster

   A typical benchmark scenario is that Basho Bench spawn Erlang VM and executes the driver inside. However, there is needs to catch performance metrics from an application executed remotely within dedicated environment (e.g. probe performance from live system; benchmark an application inside C or Java node, etc). Bash Bench implements a generic =basho_bench_driver_cluster= that acts as proxy. It uses Erlang distribution to delegate benchmark responsibility to remote actor, which is randomly selected from configured pool.

   Basho Bench do not define how the actors are spawned within SUT. It only defined a communication protocol. The actor is responsible to handle the message:

   ={pid(), atom(), key(), val()}=

   - =pid()=  : request originator, actor shall respond to this process
   - =atom()= : id of operation to execute as defined in config file
   - =key()=  : materialized key value as defined by key generator function
   - =val()=  : materialized value as defined by value generator function

   The actor executes the request, measures performance and respond to originator process =pid()= with one of the message ={ok, microsecond()}= or ={error, reason()}=

   See cluster.config example for details. Use following command to spawn benchmark

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./basho_bench -C nocookie -N bb@127.0.0.1 -J erlang@127.0.0.1 examples/cluster.config
#+END_SRC
