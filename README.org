   Basho Bench is a benchmarking tool created to conduct accurate and
   repeatable performance tests and stress tests, and produce
   performance graphs.

   Originally developed to benchmark Riak, it exposes a pluggable
   driver interface and has been extended to serve as a benchmarking
   tool across a variety of projects.

   Basho Bench focuses on two metrics of performance:

   - Throughput: number of operations performed in a timeframe,
     captured in aggregate across all operation types
   - Latency: time to complete single operations, captured in
     quantiles per-operation

** Quick Start

   You must have [[http://erlang.org/download.html][Erlang/OTP R13B03]] or later to build and run Basho
   Bench, and [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] to generate graphs of your benchmarks.  A sane
   GNU-style build system is also required if you want to use =make=
   to build the project.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git://github.com/basho/basho_bench.git
cd basho_bench
make all
#+END_SRC
   
   This will build an executable script, =basho_bench=, which you can
   use to run one of the existing benchmark configurations from the
   =examples/= directory. You will likely have to make some minor directory
   changes to the configs in order to get the examples running (see, e.g., the 
   source of the bitcask and innostore benchmark config files for direction).

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./basho_bench examples/riakc_pb.config
INFO: Est. data size: 95.37 MB
INFO: Using target ip {127,0,0,1} for worker 1
INFO: Starting max worker: <0.55.0>
#+END_SRC

   At the end of the benchmark, results will be available in CSV
   format in the =tests/current/= directory. Now you can generate a
   graph:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make results
priv/summary.r -i tests/current
Loading required package: proto
Loading required package: reshape
Loading required package: plyr
Loading required package: digest
null device 
          1 
$ open tests/current/summary.png
#+END_SRC

** Troubleshooting Graph Generation

   If make results fails with the error /usr/bin/env: Rscript --vanilla: No such file or directory
   please edit priv/summary.r and replace the first line with the full path to the Rscript binary on your system

   If you receive the error message: Warning: unable to access index for repository http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/src/contrib 
   it means the default R repo for installing additional packages is broken, you can change it as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ R
> chooseCRANmirror()
Selection: 69
quit()
make results
#+END_SRC

** Customizing your Benchmark
   Basho Bench has many drivers, each with its own configuration, and
   a number of key and value generators that you can use to customize
   your benchmark. It is also straightforward -- with less than 200
   lines of Erlang code -- to create custom drivers that can exercise
   other systems or perform custom operations. These are covered more
   in detail in the [[http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Benchmarking/][documentation]].

** Benchmarking with riak-java-client
   The [[https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client][riak-java-client]] can be used to benchmark a Riak cluster. There
   is an example configuration in =examples/riakc_java.config=. You
   will need the [[https://github.com/basho/bench_shim][bench_shim]] project. You will also need to uncomment
   and edit the following line in basho_bench's =rebar.config=, adding
   your own erlang cookie value:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
%% {escript_emu_args, "%%! -name bb@127.0.0.1 -setcookie YOUR_ERLANG_COOKIE\n"}.
#+END_SRC

** Alternative Graph Generation by gnuplot
   You can generate graphs using gnuplot.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./priv/gp_throughput.sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./priv/gp_latency.sh
#+END_SRC

   By passing =-h= option to each script, help messages are shown.

   Some of options for these scripts are:

   - =-d TEST_DIR= : comma separated list of directories which include
         test result CSV files
   - =-t TERMINAL_TYPE= : gnuplot terminal type
   - =-P= : just print gnuplot script without drawing graph

   For example, you can draw graphs with ASCII characters
   by the option =-t dumb=, which is useful in non-graphical
   environment or quick sharing of result in chat.

   Also, you can plot multiple test runs on a single plot by using "-d" switch.

** Contributing
   We encourage contributions to Basho Bench from the community.

   1) Fork the =basho_bench= repository on [[https://github.com/basho/basho_bench][Github]].
   2) Clone your fork or add the remote if you already have a clone of
      the repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/basho_bench.git
# or
git remote add mine git@github.com:yourusername/basho_bench.git
#+END_SRC
   3) Create a topic branch for your change.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout -b some-topic-branch
#+END_SRC
   4) Make your change and commit. Use a clear and descriptive commit
      message, spanning multiple lines if detailed explanation is
      needed.
   5) Push to your fork of the repository and then send a pull-request
      through Github.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git push mine some-topic-branch
#+END_SRC
   6) A Basho engineer or community maintainer will review your patch
      and merge it into the main repository or send you feedback.
